THIS IS README!

Start by making yourself a user on github, if you do not already have one:
https://github.com/join?source=header-home

Speeding up the workflow, by adding a fingerprint to your computer.
In short it means that you allow your computer to hold a key, for which github can recognize when you interact with github.

generate ssh key

Make the passphrase the same as your github account.

adding to git

Once added ssh in with:
Log in with passphrase to your github.
ssh -T git@github.com


So once we have a user, we wish to create a project (repository).
Let us make a repository, which can be done from the main page.

With our newly created github repository, we can start working.
First off we need to clone the project to our machine, but using:

git clone <repo>

Example:
git clone https://github.com/Grymer92/git

This will download the complete repository to the current directory in which you stand.
