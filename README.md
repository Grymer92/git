THIS IS README!

Start by making yourself a user on github, if you do not already have one:
https://github.com/join?source=header-home

So once we have a user, we wish to create a project (repository).
Let us make a repository, which can be done from the main page.

With our newly created github repository, we can start working.
First off we need to clone the project to our machine, but using:

git clone <repo>

Example:
git clone https://github.com/Grymer92/git

This will download the complete repository to the current directory in which you stand.
